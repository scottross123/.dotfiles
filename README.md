config shit for mac

- zsh
- nvim
- kitty
- etc

**TODO** write an install script

## Notes

- the version of nvim present in Bullseye does not work with my nvim config, need to use backports to get later version
    - [keeping a mixed system](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.en.html#s-default-version)
